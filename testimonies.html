        <h3>2025 – When You See Jesus Face to Face</h3>
        <p>
          

Earlier this year at the Kings and Priests Conference, I prayed for a friend to deeply and intimately encounter Jesus’s power—yet, little did I know, it became a setup for me (Revelation 1:17). I know in part and pray in part (1 Corinthians 13:9), but in the fullness of His presence, none of that mattered (1 Corinthians 13:10). For over an hour, I experienced a divine encounter (Revelation 1:17): pure white, pure holiness, pure beauty, and pure love. It was so real and so good. I deeply wept in that purity in gratitude that He chose me—who knows herself—to let His power rest (2 Chronicles 16:9). 

He asked me some hard questions. The core was: Would I honor Him and His Word (Hebrews 1:3) above everything and everyone else? I said “Yes,” as I have since I first knew Him at nine years old. But this year’s “Yes” came with a cost. It meant placing everything—my life in the United States, my relationships, all I had built—on the altar. It meant letting His Word alone rule my heart and not let anything else raise above it. 

As a result, I faced persecution (Matthew 5:11), false accusations, misrepresentation, and hatred (John 15:18-25) for no cause. It felt heavy, a battle of faith. I made mistakes along the way (1 Corinthians 4:4). I didn’t do things perfectly, but I did everything I knew to do, and I stood (Ephesians 6:13).  Genuinely cared friends and family who identified this as God helped me stand while I was growing weary (Galatians 6:10). In the natural realm, the end result was a huge success. Friends who witnessed the journey till the end said this is truly a miracle: open doors I couldn’t open, opportunities I didn’t deserve, blessings beyond what I imagined.

His grace showed me true love (2 Corinthians 12:9), and how much He loved me. His grace taught me to love in the midst of the trails of life, and revealed that faith works through love (Galatians 5:6). He became my everything. I wouldn’t want anything like this battle again, but the intimacy it gave me with Him is something I wouldn’t trade for anything else. He became my exceedingly great reward. And in those moments, I recognized that all my soul really craved and longed for was Him.

I share this testimony (Revelation 19:10) to encourage you that He is good, faithful, and a loving Father. No matter your situation, regardless of how impossible it looks like, He knows your end from the beginning. He made you: your frame was not hidden from Him (Psalm 139:15). He loves you, and He cares deeply for you. I pray you experience the joy of His love this Christmas and prepare your heart for the new year with expectation of His faithfulness.
